      <p>WðŸª±UðŸª±RðŸª±M is an experimental space for everything that sounds adventurous, exploratory, noisy, improvised,
        speculative, and charmingly weird â€” bringing together old and new friends from Basel and around. Founded in 2011,
        it has been crawling its path to the new soil at ADW11, evolving into a buzzy and clunky hub for workshops,
        performances, collaborative projects, and all that can be tagged as extra-academic and trans-institutional.</p>
